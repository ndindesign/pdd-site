      The Neurodiversity in Design European Working group was founded in 2017 by
      Yurgos Politis, Nigel Robb, and Bryan Boyle. We follow the UN and EU in
      believing that access to suitable services, products, and technologies, is
      one of the
      <a href="{{ site.url }}/rights">rights of people with autism and intellectual disabilities</a>,
      and we think that
      <a href="{{ site.url }}/pd">participatory design</a>
      represents an exciting way of ensuring this right.

        Yurgos Politis completed a Physics degree at the University of Athens,
        qualifying as a Physics teacher. He then undertook a Masters in Education
        and a PhD in Education in University College Dublin. He is currently a
        Marie Curie Fellow with the ASSISTID programme, spending two years at
        Michigan State University and one at University College Dublin. His project,
        Virtual Learning for people with ASD, will offer training on communication
        skills through a Virtual World. He will develop an intervention personalized
        to the needs and preferences of each participant to ease their transition
        from education to independent life.
