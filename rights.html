      The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
      states that parties undertake a number of general obligations, including:
      <blockquote>
        To undertake or promote research and development of universally designed
        goods, services, equipment and facilities ... which should require the minimum
        possible adaptation and the least cost to meet the specific needs of a person
        with disabilities.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        To undertake or promote research and development of, and to promote the
        availability and use of new technologies, including information and communications
        technologies, mobility aids, devices and assistive technologies, suitable for
        persons with disabilities, giving priority to technologies at an affordable cost.
      </blockquote>
      The UN convention was ratified by the European Union in December 2010, marking
      the first time in its history that the EU became a party to an international
      human rights treaty.

      The EU's European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 seeks "to empower people with
      disabilities so that they can enjoy their full rights, and benefit fully from
      participating in society." To achieve this, the strategy recommends, among
      other things, the importance of considering the needs of people with disabilities
      during the design of products, services, environments, education, and training.

      It is estimated that between 5 and 15 million EU citizens have an intellectual
      disability.  While the complexity of diagnosis, and the potential co-morbidity
      of Autism and intellectual disability, make it more difficult to determine the
      exact prevalence of Autism, it is believed to be of a similar magnitude.
      This represents a substantial group of EU citizens whose unique needs and
      preferences must be considered during the design of products, services, and
      environments. The inclusion of these individualsâ€™ perspectives is an essential
      factor in the realisation of their fundamental rights, their empowerment,
      and their full participation in European society.
