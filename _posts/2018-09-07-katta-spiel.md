In this post, we're introducing one of the speakers who will attend the Neurodiversity in Design Discussion Forum on 4th October 2018 at University College Dublin (see [here](http://neurodiversityindesign.eu/2018/09/07/ucd-event/) for more info.).

[Katta Spiel](http://igw.tuwien.ac.at/hci/people/kspiel) has a background in Cultural Studies and Computer Science from Bauhaus-Universit√§t Weimar. Katta's PhD centers around experiences of autistic children with technologies and including their first-hand perspectives. Katta was part of the successful OutsideTheBox project in which the research team co-designed technologies with individual autistic children and is now part of Social Play Technologies, where we design technologies supporting social play between autistic and allistic children together with them. Other research interests include Games and Play, Critical Computer Science, Gender Studies and Philosophy of Science.
