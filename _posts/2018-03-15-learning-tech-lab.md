Last night we were very grateful to be able to give a presentation on our work at Learning Tech Labs [Neuroscience in Education](https://www.meetup.com/Learning-Tech-Labs/events/247020644/) event in Dublin. Nigel Robb presented an overview of the challenges faced in the field of participatory design with neurodiverse populations, and outlined our plans to increase collaboration in this field and advance the state of the art, all with the aim of making software, products, and services more inclusive for people with autism and/or intellectual disabilities. The audience had some really insightful questions and comments, and the whole event was really enjoyable. You can see a copy of Nigel's slides [here](htpps://google.com). Thanks to David Pollard and everyone at Learning Tech Labs for giving us the opportunity to speak to such a great audience!
