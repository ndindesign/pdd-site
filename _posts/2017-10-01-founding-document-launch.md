We're pleased to be able to release a draft version of our [Founding Document](http://neurodiversityindesign.eu/files/founding-doc-01102017.pdf "Founding Document"), which is freely available to download and read. The document primarily serves to position the Working Group, and introduce the founding members. Most of this content is also freely available on this site. In addition, the document contains a timeline of our planned activities for the first 12 months of operation, from September 2017 to August 2018.
