We're pleased to announce that we have been awarded a small grant through the [Seed Funding Scheme](http://www.ucd.ie/research/about/internalfundingschemes/seedfundingtestimonials/) at University College Dublin. The purpose of the grant is to contribute to costs associated with organising a workshop on Neurodiversity in Design. Stay tuned for updates; we expect to hold the event in summer 2018. Thanks to University College Dublin for their support!
