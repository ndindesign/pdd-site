The Neurodiversity in Design group will be hosting a discussion forum at University College Dublin on 4th October, 2018. We are thrilled to be joined by guest speakers [Dr Laura Malinverni](http://www.lauramalinverni.org/) and [Dr Katta Spiel](http://igw.tuwien.ac.at/hci/people/kspiel), who will both be sharing their expertise and knowledge in the field of participatory design (PD) for people with autism and/or intellectual disabilities. In addition, an example of some recent PD work in Ireland will be showcased and discussed, with the participants sharing their views on the process. There will also be time for open discussion about the current state and future directions of participatory design. More updates to follow.
