Today the first version of our website goes live. We're still working on some content, so you may see quite frequent updates over the next few weeks. As a short-term aim (i.e. by the end of 2017), we plan to transition to a fully accessible website, based on the [infusion framework](https://fluidproject.org/infusion.html "Infusion | fluid"). For now, though, we have used large text and a high-contrast colour scheme throughout. We're also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NDinDesign "@NDinDesign"), so why not follow us for updates on our activities. Finally, we hope to launch a mailing list by the end of 2017.
